# CactusDetection
Cactus detection challenge is a beginner level Playground challenge hosted on Kaggle. This challenge was created by researchers in Mexico to build an autonomous surveillance system of protected areas.

The dataset contains aerial images that fall into one of the two classes, "has_cactus" and "no_cactus". The images are formatted and resized to 32*32 size for ease of use and it is a kernel's only competition. We'll walk through the code and see how to achieve an accuracy of 99.9% by training a simple convolutional network from scratch using Keras. Let's get rolling!
